Project by Anna Yanchenko and Megan Robertson for Statistics 663 - Statistical Computation in Spring 2016 at Duke Univeristy with Professors Cliburn Chan and Janice McCarthy. 

Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) is a method used to model the generative process of creating discrete data such as text corpora. LDA can take a large amount of data and create descriptions of that data. This method reduces the size of the data to these short descriptions while still maintaining the relationships necessary to carry out various inferences. For this project, we implemented the LDA algorithm presented in the paper Latent Dirichlet Allocation, written by David M. Blei, Andrew Y. Ng, and Michael I. Jordan. The implementation of the algorithm is used to analyze the text of some famous American historical documents and to create clusters of movies based on user rating data.
